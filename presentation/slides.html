# Protocols for Loanable Funds (PLF)

* Protocol that intermediates funds between users
* Unlike peer-to-peer lending, funds are pooled
* Requires users to deposit collateral

# PLF definitions

* *Market* A smart contract acting as the intermediary of loanable funds for a particular crypto-asset, where users supply and borrow funds.
* *Supply* Funds deposited to a market that can be loaned out to other users and used as collateral against depositors’ own borrow positions.
* *Borrow* Funds loaned out to users of a market.
* *Collateral* Funds available to back a user’s aggregate borrow positions.
* *Locked funds* Funds remaining in the PLF smart contracts, equal to the difference between supplied and borrowed funds.

# Agents in the system

* *Supplier* A user who deposits funds to a market.
* *Borrower* A user who borrows funds from a market. Since a borrow position must be collateralized by deposited funds, a borrower must also be a supplier.
* *Liquidator* A user who purchases a borrower’s supply in a market when the borrower’s collateral to borrow ratio falls below some threshold.

# PLF building blocks

* *Interest rate models*: Some function(s) taking liquidity as an argument and returning an interest rate
* *Interest disbursement mechanism*: Interest typically accrued per second and paid out per block. Often an interest bearing derivative token used.
* *Collateral*: Deposit that can be sold off to recover the debt of a defaulted position
* *Liquidations*: The process of selling a borrower’s collateral to recover the debt value upon default
* *Governance mechanism*: Decentralized governance typically achieved through an ERC-20 governance token, where token holders' votes are in proportion to their stake

## Deep reinforcement learning

### Overview
* A type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards.
* Combines the concepts of Reinforcement Learning with deep learning techniques.
* Uses deep neural networks as function approximators to represent the policy, value function, or model of the environment.



### Components of Deep Reinforcement Learning

* *Agent*: The agent takes actions in the environment.
* *Environment*: The environment is the world in which the agent operates and receives rewards for its actions.
* *State*: The state represents the current condition of the environment.
* *Action*: The action is taken by the agent in response to the state.
* *Reward*: The reward is feedback received by the agent in response to its actions.

## Empirical data

## Modelling framework

### A simplified DeFi environment for training
* One PLF pool
* One aggregate market user
* One adjustable risk parameter: collateral factor
* Pre-programmed user behavior reactive to market condition

## Preliminary results

## Future direction

## Conclusion
